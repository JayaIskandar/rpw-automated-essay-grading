1,"In recent years, there has been a massive interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for a variety of tasks ranging from text translation to the question answering chatbot. Large language models (LLMs) are the branch of Artificial intelligence (AI) that have emerged as powerful tools for a wide range of tasks, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine translation, and question-answering (Hadi, et al., 2023). One of the use cases where LLM can be implemented is to help lecturers in students� writing assessments process. Traditionally, lecturers would receive their students� writing papers that need to be assessed by giving some constructive feedback before they return the paper to the respective students. However, the essay grading process done by lecturers alone is often time-consuming and prone to subjectivity (Rudner & Gagne, 2001).Lecturers face the challenge of assessing numerous essays, with each student receiving individual feedback tailored to their strengths and weaknesses. This personalized approach, while crucial for effective learning, can be resource-intensive and inconsistent. In this context, the development of LLM for essay grading has emerged as a promising solution. LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Natural Language Processing tasks, including sentiment analysis, summarization, and question answering. Natural language processing (NLP) is a technical and quantitative field that involves the use of computer algorithms and techniques to analyze, understand, and generate human language (Osterrieder, 2023). These abilities suggest the potential for LLMs to be trained to assess essays in a more efficient and objective manner. Furthermore, by letting LLMs do the essays grading, it may reduce the burden of educators allowing them to focus on a more qualitative approach in terms of teaching. However, LLMs are often trained on large amounts of data that is not relevant to the specific task. This can lead to poor performance on the specific target task.",4,,4
